In your terminal, run the following code to install dependencies:
```
>>> pip install flask
>>> pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```

In your terminal, run the following code:
```
>>> python
>>> from movies import db
>>> db.create_all()
```

In your terminal, run the following code to start your Flask server:
```
>>> python api.py
```
